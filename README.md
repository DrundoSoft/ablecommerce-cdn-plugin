AbleCommerce Gold CDN Plugin

CDN stands for Content Delivery Network or Content Distribution Network. Basically, it’s a bunch of highly optimized servers all across the world, with a bit of unique logic worked into them: you’ll always hit the server that’s closest to you. This leads to huge performance improvements for AbleCommerce sites that have product category pages with a lot of images.

The CDN works with so called Pull URL’s. This means you specify a directory on your server that it pulls all files from, which it then starts serving from the CDN. This allows ecommerce site owners and webmasters to keep managing products and images trough the same AbleCommerce admin interface or FTP while taking advantage of hundreds of CDN servers located all over the world.

A CDN Solution for AbleCommerce
We have developed a custom AbleCommerce plugin which  will move all site images, java script and css files into CDN automatically. You can have your AbleCommerce 7 site switched to CDN in less than 5 minutes. The CDN plugin comes with One-Click install script which will automatically download and configure all required plugin files. Switching your site CDN service On/Off is as simple as checking a check box.

Who should be using an AbleCommerce CDN solution?
Because it distributes your data across the globe, a CDN is beneficial for pretty much everyone. Larger AbleCommerce storefronts and sites with a lot of traffic, sites serving videos or other downloadable files benefit most, as it speeds up these downloads. Other sites that benefit are sites that are often on Digg or other huge sites – as it spreads the load across a network of servers, rather than just one web server.
